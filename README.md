# Pwning Cogs
A repo for cogs that I make... whenever that may be. These are the current cogs and what they do.

## isitchristmas
A cog that tells tells you if it is a specific holiday. Basically, this is a personal test to see if I can code it.

##### Currently supports:
- [x] Christmas
- [x] Halloween
- [x] Valentine's Day
- [x] April Fool's Day
- [x] Independence Day (America)
- [x] Thanksgiving (America)
- [ ] Others?

##### Future goals for this cog:
- [ ] Change to group command `isit` with the sub command of the holiday (ex.`[p]isit Christmas`)
