A repo for cogs that I make... whenever that may be. These are the current cogs and what they do.

A cog that tells tells you if it is a specific holiday when you ask.

## [Unit Converter](https://github.com/pwnulatr/Pwning-Cogs/tree/master/unitconverter)
A cog that converts from one unit of measurement to another and displays the result in chat.

## [YouTube Thumbnail Retriever](https://github.com/pwnulatr/Pwning-Cogs/tree/master/youtubethumbail)
(Slightly Wonky)

A cog that retrieves the thumbnail from a YouTube video link and sends the Thumbnail into chat. It also caches it on the hosts computer for later use. (Not fully implemented yet)
