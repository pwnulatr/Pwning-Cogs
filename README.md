# Pwning Cogs
A repo for cogs that I make... whenever that may be. These are the current cogs and what they do.

## isitchristmas
A cog that tells tells you if it is a specific holiday. Basically, this is a personal test to see if I can code it.

#### Currently supports:
- [x] Christmas
- [x] Halloween
- [x] Valentine's Day
- [x] April Fool's Day
- [x] Independence Day (America)
- [x] Thanksgiving (America)
- [ ] Others?

#### Possible future goals for this cog:
- [ ] Use a config file of some kind to allow users to add their own holidays
- [ ] Notify users of a holiday in a specified chat

## YouTubeThumbnail
A cog that extracts the thumbnail from a YouTube video link and sends the Thumbnail into chat. It also caches it on the hosts computer for later use.

Currently only supports long urls (ex. `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX`)

#### Future goals for this cog:
- [ ] Support all types of URLs from YouTube such as `youtu.be` URLs
- [ ] Enable/Disable Caching of the Thumbnail on the hosts machine with a command
- [ ] Make bot upload the image rather than post a link to the image
