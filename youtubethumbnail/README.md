# YouTube Thumbnail Retriever
A cog that, when given a YouTube link, will retrieve the HD thumbnail and send it in the chat.

Will only work with long YouTube URLs, ex. `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX`
## Syntax: `[p]thumbnail <videourl>`
#### Future goals for this cog:
- Support all types of URLs from YouTube such as `youtu.be` URLs
- Enable/Disable Caching of the Thumbnail on the hosts machine with a command
- Make bot upload the image rather than post a link to the image
- ~~Actually get it to work properly~~ Optimize code further
