# Date Status Timer
Uses the bot's playing status as a countdown to an event.

### Syntax:

`[p]datestatusset <month|day|name>` Commands for setting date for event

`[p]datestatusset force_update` Forces an update to the status if it isn't working properly.

### Notes:
Does not work with rndstatus Cog, so `<p>unload rndstatus` while using this cog. Once you
no longer need it, unload this one and load rndstatus again.
