# Date Status Timer
Uses the bot's playing status as a countdown to an event.

### Syntax:

`[p]datestatusset <month|day|name>` Commands for setting date for event

`[p]datestatusset force_update` Forces an update to the status if it isn't working properly.

### Notes:
The changing of the date is activated by public chat messages, so if there are no messages, it will not update until there is one.
